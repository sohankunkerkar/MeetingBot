The functionality of the bot can be divided into three basic use cases.

**Use case 1: Setting up a meeting**
```
1 Preconditions
   User must have google calendar api tokens in setup in the system.

2 Main Flow
   User will request bot to create a meeting and provides list of attendees, date and duration. [S1]. The bot finds
   the most suitable time and place for meeting and waits for confirmation from the user [S2]. Upon confirmation the
   bot creates the meeting and posts link[S3].

3 Sub flows
•	[S1] User 1 will alert the bot. Bot requests for the list of attendees which the user provides
  (User provides /meeting command with @username1, @username2 list). The user will provide meeting
  duration and date of the meeting upon bot’s request (Eg. 1 hour, tomorrow).
•	[S2] The bot finds the most suitable time and location for the meeting and sets up the meeting
  at the most feasible time as per instructions as waits for confirmation from the user.
•	[S3] Upon confirmation the bot creates the meeting and send emails/posts link.

4 Alternative Flows
  [E1] Not able to find suitable because no team members are available or all meeting rooms are booked

```



**Use case 2: Add a member to the meeting**
```

   members to the already created meeting and notify all the attendees [S2].

3 Sub flows
•	[S1] The user will tell the bot that he wants to add a new member or a set of members to the meeting which was created
  earlier. He provides the username of these new attendees. (Eg. Add a new member. @username 3, username 4)
